# GoalGuru for Borealis AI Let's Solve It
GoalGuru is a Slapshot analysis and classification pipeline created for the 2024 cohort of Borealis AI's Let's Solve It project internship. By leveraging cutting-edge pose estimation models and data-driven insights, GoalGuru analyzes slapshot mechanics to provide players with actionable feedback for improving shot speed, accuracy, and power efficiency.

# Key Features
AI-Powered Shot Analysis: Uses Google MediaPipe to track body mechanics and extract essential biomechanical data from shot videos.
Data-Driven Insights: Quantifies critical metrics like hand velocity, feet distance, and rotational sequence to refine technique.
Custom Training Data: Built on high-quality shot clips collected with the University of Victoria hockey team.
Advanced Modeling: Employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for precise shot classification and feedback.

# Future Goals
Expand datasets across skill levels to enhance model robustness.
Develop a mobile app for real-time shot recording, analysis, and progress tracking.
Deliver advanced feedback for targeted improvements in player performance.
